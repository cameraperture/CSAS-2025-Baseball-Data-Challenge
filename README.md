Accessing the code:
All code used in the data challenge report can be found in the data_challenge_code.Rmd file.

The data file can be downloaded from the shared OneDrive folder at https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/brian_macdonald_yale_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fbrian%5Fmacdonald%5Fyale%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Fservice%2FCSAS%2F2025%2D04%2D11%20%2D%20CSAS%20at%20Yale%2Fdata%2Echallenge%2Fdata&ga=1. 

Each code chunk has a comment explaining what the code does.

There is an additional code file named additional_code.Rmd that contains code that was not used in the report or analysis.

The shiny_app folder contains a shiny app where you can visualize cluster distributions. Open the file in R and press Run App. Ensure the data file located in the shiny_app folder is in your working directory.
